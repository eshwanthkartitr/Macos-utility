# Macos-utility

A simple utility to fix custom Aerial wallpaper issues on macOS Sequoia and Tahoe.

## The Problem

The original WallpaperVideoExtensionFix worked for earlier macOS versions but failed on **macOS Sequoia (15.x)** and **macOS Tahoe**, causing:
- Blank/gray screens on login
- Custom Aerial wallpapers not loading properly
- System conflicts with WallpaperVideoExtension service

## The Solution

This enhanced version fixes those issues and works seamlessly with modern macOS versions.

## How to Use

1. **Download** the latest release
2. **Extract** and run the app once to grant permissions
3. **Add to Login Items**: System Preferences → Users & Groups → Login Items
4. **Restart** your Mac

That's it! The utility runs silently in the background and fixes your wallpaper issues automatically.

## Compatibility

- ✅ macOS Sequoia (15.x)
- ✅ macOS Tahoe
- ❌ Earlier versions (use original version)

## Credits

Based on the original WallpaperVideoExtensionFix by Proton0. Enhanced for modern macOS compatibility.
